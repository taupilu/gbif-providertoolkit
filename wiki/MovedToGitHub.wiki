= Moved to GitHub =

The IPT source code and issue tracking is now managed in GitHub and available at the following address: https://github.com/gbif/ipt

The reason this project is moving to GitHub, is that Google is bidding farewell to Google Code. You can read more about how Google Code is being phased out [http://google-opensource.blogspot.dk/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html here].

The IPT User Manual and Wiki is still in the process of being migrated. Therefore until the User Manual and Wiki migration is complete, please continue to use the versions found here, in the IPT's Google Code site. 

Thanks
